The project is a story that emerges from and is told alongside a dataset.

## Context

Since the very beginning of the emergence of college education, it has been believed that college education can either keep or raise people's social classes. A simple example is that, back then, people went for philosophy, history, and law. While nowadays, people turn their attention from liberal arts to computer science, computer engineering, and finance. In addition, with this belief, people have tried hard and paid a lot to get a college education. However, when I went job hunting months ago, I started to realize this huge financial gap between the spending on education and the return I get (salary). With this rising tuition and weak labor market, I started to doubt about this belief of college education. These doubts led me to more research on topics such as returns on education and labor market trends. Meanwhile, I collected some data and visualized them as a tool to review the claims made on college education. 

### The Dataset - Returns to Education
Click [here](https://ourworldindata.org/returns-to-education) to see the detailed description.

This report focuses on the skill premium - the ratio of the wages of the skilled workers to the unskilled workers. In the present context, the "skilled workers" basically means workers with a bachelor's degree or higher, and the "unskilled workers" means those without a bachelor's degree.
The report talks about how the skill premium changes from 1300s till now, and guesses on the reasons of these raises and falls. It further introduces the education inequality in the US as well as the relation between skill premium and labor supply.

However, many questions can be asked based on this dataset. For example, if the skill premium relates to the [happiness and life balance](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction)? If the skill premium of men and women are similar to each other? Is there an education inequality between genders too? Does higher degree bring people a better life?

The dataset also talks about the ROI (return on investment) of college education, which I think is a good topic. It will be interesting to find the relations between the ROI of education to the education inequality, as well as the current educational cost on children.

### The Dataset - Working Hours

Working hours can relate to many aspects of hour life, and it can also reflect many sociological phenomena. The dataset talks about the change of working hours from the Industrial Revolution. It also indicates that people in richer countries would work less. It's also somehow related to gender inequality in housework.

Even though there are already many correlations found under this topic, there are still some other aspects that I want to explore. Does the decrease of working hours bring more happiness to people? How is working hours related to [Human Development Index](https://ourworldindata.org/human-development-index)? Is it possible to show the working hours for only male or female, only skilled workers or unskilled workers?
