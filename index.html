            <p>Let’s start the conversation with this.</p>
            <img class="meme" src="images/mismatch.png">
            <p>
              In both the East and the West, it is common to regard education as a tool to help find a good job.
              People believe that education can change their destiny and become a channel for upward movement of
              different social classes.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the turbulent job market and the rising tuition don’t say so.
              As a college student, the mismatch of the invest (the college education) and the return (a good job)
              makes me doubt if this common notion on education is even right. So I made some research and visualized
              some data to figure out if college education has ever been “a channel for upward movement of different social classes”.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
              The following research are mainly focusing on the two enrollment types: <strong>public 4-year</strong>,
               and <strong style="color:#dc8665">private 4-year</strong>.

            <img class="meme" src="images/bill.jpg">
            <p>
              Seriously though, we are paying more than just “tuition”. The “sticker price” of our college education
              is the sum of our “tuition and fees” and “room and board” (TFRB). “Tuition and fees” is charged for all students,
              while “room and board” is only charged for those living on campus.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, there are also other kinds of expenses, such as books and supplies, transportation, and personal expenses.
              They might not be counted into your tuition, but surely they sould be considered when making a budget.
            </p>
            <p id="tuition_budget_trigger">
              Among all school types, this is the average budget for a <strong>4-year private college education in 2019</strong>.
            </p>
            <div class="box" id="budget_chart">
            <p>➡️</p>
            </div>
          <!-- </div> -->

          <!-- <div class="sections" id="tuition_rise"> -->
            <h2 id="tuition_rise">Tuition Rise</h2>

                <p id="TFRB_trigger">
                  Well, 1500% might be a little crazy, but let’s take a look at how much tuition has actualy risen in the past
                  20 years, from 1999 to 2019. To make the data more accurate, the amounts are all in 2019 dollar, which
                  means the inflation is already considered.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The two college types here are: <strong style="color:#eeb462">public 4-year</strong>,
                   and <strong style="color:#dc8665">private 4-year</strong>.
                </p>
                <div class="box" id="rise_chart_01">
                <p>➡️</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                  It seems like for either the private college or the public college, the tuition has rasen in the past 20 years.
                  And if looking at the chart carefully, we can find out that the tuition kept rising every year, except for 2008, when the
                  <strong>2008 Financial Crisis</strong> happened.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What if I tell you that TFRB is not usually what we pay for? Yep, there are grants and scholarships.
                  So, what we really pay is the TFRB subtracting the grants and scholarships, which is also
                   called the “net price”, or the “net TFRB”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Let’s see how that has changed through time compared to the TFRB.
                </p>
                <div class="box" id="rise_chart_02">
                <p>➡️</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                  Now we can conclude that the tuition hasn't rasen that much? Not really. The NET TFRB has rasen around $5,000 in the past 20 years.
                  As all data are converted into 2019 dollar, we can assume that the rise still gives more pressure to the students.

          <!-- <div class="sections" id="theories"> -->
            <h2 id="theories">Theories</h2>
                <p>
                  There are several theories on the causes of tuition rises. I find the following two really intriguing.
                </p>

                <h3>The Bennett Hypothesis</h3>
                    <p>
                      In 1987, then-Education Secretary Willian J. Bennett made an argument that federal loan is a main cause of the
                      tuition rise. In his work <i>Our Greedy Colleges</i>, he said:
                    </p>
                    <div class="quotes"><q>
                      If anything, increases in financial aid in recent years have enabled colleges and universities blithely to raise
                      their tuitions, confident that Federal loan subsidies would help cushion the increase … Federal student aid policies
                      do not cause college price inflation, but there is little doubt that they help make it possible.
                    </q></div>
                    <p>
                      So, how much has the student loan changed in the past 20 years?
                    </p>
                    <!-- <div class="svg_demo"><p>(student loan amount change and TFRB change)</p></div> -->
                    <div class="box" id="theory_chart_01">
                    <p>➡️</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      It seems like there is no such positive correlation between tuition rise and student loan. The tuition rise is more rapid than
                      the rise in student loans. Thus, instead of saying that the rise in student loan causes tuition rise, it's more reasonable to argue
                      that the drastic rise in tuition keeps low-income-family students from college education resources as well as forces
                      more students to look for more alternatives for financial aids and loans. For maintaining the <strong>equality in education</strong>,
                      the government had to then provide more grants to the students to cover their bill. Meanwhile, some businesses provided scholarships to students
                      while others saw this as a new business and started to provide loans to students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      What's fun is that later in 2013, Bennet revised his hypothesis as follows:
                    </p>
                    <div class="quotes"><q>
                      If the federal government gives money, tuition goes up. If the federal government doesn’t give money, it goes up
                      … Federal student aid makes it easier for colleges to do what they’re going to do anyway, which is raise tuition.
                    </q></div>
                    <img class="meme" src="images/bullshit.jpg">
                    <br>

                <h3>Baumol's Cost Disease</h3>
                    <p>
                      This is a complicated one, it’s the rise of salaries in jobs that have experienced no or low increase of labor
                      productivity, in response to rising salaries in other jobs that have experienced higher labor productivity growth.
                      Simply it means, people doing jobs that can't be measured by labor productivity are paid more based on the years
                      they have done the job.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When it comes to education, it means college has to pay higher salaries year by year. It’s reasonable for the
                      students to pay more tuition to cover the cost, as they are the direct beneficiary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      OK, let’s take a look at the salary of college professor.
                    </p>
                    <div class="box" id="theory_chart_02">
                    <del>➡️</del>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      I couldn't find any representive data. All official data stops at secondary education. <del> So we can conclude that
                      professors don't get paid.</del>
                    </p>
          <!-- </div> -->

          <!-- <div class="sections" id="job_market"> -->
              <h2 id="job_market">Job Market</h2>
              <p>
                Some college students will decide to go for a post-graduate education, while the others will enter the job market.
                For those in the job market, they will encounter three different scenarios:
                getting a dream job, getting underemployed, or get unemployed.
              </p>
              <p>To examine if college education has helped us find a better job, let's see the performance in four labor types:
                <strong style="color:#2c6975">all workers</strong>, <strong style="color:#68b2a0">young workers</strong>,
                 <strong style="color:#cd7672">all college graduates</strong>,
                <strong style="color:#dc8665">recent college graduates</strong>.
              </p>

              <h3>Unemployment</h3>
              <p>
                “Unemployment” occuers when workers who want to work are not able to find a job.
                Let's take a look at the unemployment rate of the four labor types.
              </p>
              <div class="box" id="job_chart_01">
              <p>➡️</p>
              </div>
              <p>
                The overall trend for each labor type are very similar to each other. Obviously, getting a college education will not
                prevent you from the historical trend of unemployment. What college education provides is, when job cut happens, college graduates
                seem to be lessly to get cut. Thus, college graduates seemingly secure their job better than those without a tertiary education.
              </p>

              <h3>Underemployment</h3>
              <p>
                “Underemployment” means either the employee is overqualified for the position
                or the employee is holding a part-time job while wanting a full-time one.
                Let's take a look at the underemployment rate.
              </p>
              <p>
                For this one, let's more focus on <strong style="color:#cd7672">all college graduates</strong> and
               <strong style="color:#dc8665">recent college graduates</strong>.
              </p>
              <div class="box" id="job_chart_02">
              <p>➡️</p>
              </div>
              <p>
                For recent college graduates, the bad news is, around 40% of us will get underemployed.
                The good news is, in several years, some of us will get a better job. Only 35% of us will still be underemployed.
              </p>

              <img class="meme" src="images/capitalist.jpg">
              <p>To understand this better. The wage categories are divided into <strong style="color:#eeb462">College 25th percentile (Q1)</strong>,
                <strong style="color:#cd7672">College Median (Q2)</strong>, <strong style="color:#dc8665">College 75th percentile (Q3)</strong>,

                The fact is, 25% of the college graduates earns almost the same as high school graduates. Let's wish them the best.
              </p>
